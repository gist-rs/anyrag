# NOW: Project Status and Next Steps

This document tracks the implementation of the features outlined in `PLAN.md`.

## Phase 1: Core Library Implementation (Completed)

- [x] **Setup Module and Core Types**
- [x] **Implement Example Extraction Logic**
- [x] **Create Main Ingestion Orchestrator**

## Phase 2: Server API and RAG Integration (Completed)

- [x] **Implement API Endpoints**
- [x] **Integrate Multi-DB RAG Logic**

## Phase 3: Testing and Refinement (Completed)

- [x] **Write Integration and E2E Tests**

## Phase 4: CLI Refinement and GitHub Integration (Completed)

- [x] **Refactor CLI for Modularity**
- [x] **Implement `dump github` Command**
- [x] **Update CLI Documentation**

## Phase 5: Bug Fixes and Finalization (Completed)

- [x] **Fix Database Constraint Issue**
    - [x] Implemented a "delete then insert" strategy in `store_examples` to ensure idempotent dumps and prevent unique constraint errors.

## Phase 6: RAG from Consolidated Context (Completed)

- [x] **Implement Context File Chunking**: The `process file` command now chunks Markdown files.
- [x] **Store Chunks**: The `dump github` command now automatically chunks and stores the consolidated context file.

## Phase 7: GitHub Example RAG (Completed)

- [x] **Embed Stored Code Examples**: The `dump github` command now generates and stores embeddings for extracted code examples.
- [x] **Enhance RAG Endpoint**: The `/search/examples` endpoint now uses a hybrid search (keyword + vector) with AI-powered query analysis to retrieve relevant code examples.

## Phase 8: Advanced RAG (Completed)

- [x] **Implement Metadata Pre-filtering for GitHub Search**: Apply the metadata-based pre-filtering strategy (currently used in the knowledge base search) to the GitHub example search to improve performance and relevance by using extracted entities.
