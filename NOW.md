# Current Work In Progress: Search Refactoring

This document tracks the immediate next steps for completing the refactoring of the hybrid search functionality.

## Objective

The goal is to evolve the `hybrid_search` function and its surrounding logic to be more robust, performant, and user-configurable, as outlined in `PLAN.md`.

## Summary

The `hybrid_search` function and its surrounding logic have been successfully refactored. All pending tasks are now complete.

## Completed Tasks

-   [x] **Refactor `hybrid_search` to use an `Options` struct:**
    -   Defined a `HybridSearchOptions` struct to encapsulate parameters, improving code clarity.
    -   Updated the `hybrid_search` function signature and all call sites to use this struct.

-   [x] **Implement Parallel Execution and Soft Failure:**
    -   Refactored `hybrid_search` to use `tokio::spawn` and `await` for true concurrent execution of keyword and vector searches.
    -   Implemented a "soft failure" mechanism to ensure the pipeline continues even if one search method fails.

-   [x] **Update All `hybrid_search` Call Sites:**
    -   All calls in handlers, examples, and tests have been updated to the new function signature.

-   [x] **Final Diagnostic Run:**
    -   `cargo test` confirms the entire project is free of errors and regressions.
