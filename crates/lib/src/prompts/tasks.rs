// --- Query Generation ---
pub const QUERY_GENERATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT: &str = r#"You are an intelligent data assistant for {db_name}. Analyze the user's request.
- If the request can be answered by querying the database, respond with a single, read-only {language} query.
- Otherwise, respond with a direct, helpful answer.
Do not add explanations or apologies. Provide only the query or the answer."#;

pub const QUERY_GENERATION_USER_PROMPT: &str = r#"Your task is to write a single, read-only {language} query based on the provided schema and question. Your primary objective is to select all columns needed to satisfy the # Primary Goal.

{alias_instruction}

# User question

{context}

# Query Construction Rules
1. For questions about "who", "what", or "list", use DISTINCT to avoid duplicate results.
2. When filtering, always explicitly exclude NULL values (e.g., `your_column IS NOT NULL`).
3. For questions about "today", you MUST use one of the formats provided in the # TODAY context. Choose the format that matches the data in the relevant date column. If the column is TEXT, you may need to use string matching (e.g., `your_column LIKE 'YYYY-MM-DD%'`).
4. For searches involving a person's name, use a `LIKE` clause for partial matching (e.g., `name_column LIKE 'John%'`).
5. If a Japanese name includes an honorific like "さん", remove the honorific before using the name in the query.
6. For keyword searches (e.g., 'Rust'), it is vital to search across multiple fields. Your `WHERE` clause must use `LIKE` and `OR` to check for the keyword in all plausible text columns based on the schema. For example, you should check fields like `subject_name`, `class_name`, and `memo`.
7. **Crucially, do not format data in the query** (e.g., using `TO_CHAR` or `FORMAT`). Return raw numbers and dates. Formatting is handled separately.
8. **Compatibility Constraint**: You MUST NOT use subqueries (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM (SELECT ...)` or `WHERE col IN (SELECT ...)`). Use `JOIN`s or simplified `WHERE` clauses instead.
9. Use the provided table schema to ensure the query is correct. Do not use placeholders for table or column names."#;

# Instructions:
1.  Analyze each "Content Chunk" provided in the input. Each chunk is clearly separated and has a unique integer ID.
2.  For each chunk, create a single, clear question that the content fully and accurately answers.
3.  The question should be phrased as a real user would ask it and must contain rich keywords for better searchability.
4.  **Language Rule**: You **MUST** generate the question in the same language as the original 'Content Chunk'. For example, if the content is in Thai, the question must be in Thai.
5.  Return a single JSON object containing a list named `augmented_faqs`. Each item in the list must correspond to one of the input chunks.

# JSON Output Schema:
{
  "augmented_faqs": [

      "id": <The integer ID of the original content chunk>,

# Instructions:
1.  **Entities**: Identify specific, proper nouns. These are unique, identifiable items like people, products, organizations, locations, or specific dates.
2.  **Keyphrases**: Identify the 5-10 most important thematic concepts or topics in the text. These should be broader than entities and capture the main ideas.
3.  **Language Rule**: You **MUST** generate the metadata in the same language as the original text. For example, if the content is in Thai, the metadata must be in Thai.
4.  Return a single JSON array of objects. Do not include any other text or explanations.

# JSON Object Schema:
Each object in the array must have the following keys:
- `type`: Must be either 'ENTITY' or 'KEYPHRASE'.
- `subtype`: For 'ENTITY', specify what it is (e.g., 'PERSON', 'PRODUCT', 'ORGANIZATION', 'CONCEPT'). For 'KEYPHRASE', use 'CONCEPT'.
- `value`: The extracted string value of the entity or keyphrase.
