//! This module contains the default, hardcoded prompt templates for all standard application tasks.

// --- Query Generation ---
pub const QUERY_GENERATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT: &str = r#"You are an intelligent data assistant for {db_name}. Analyze the user's request.
- If the request can be answered by querying the database, respond with a single, read-only {language} query.
- Otherwise, respond with a direct, helpful answer.
Do not add explanations or apologies. Provide only the query or the answer."#;

pub const QUERY_GENERATION_USER_PROMPT: &str = r#"Your task is to write a single, read-only {language} query based on the provided schema and question. Your primary objective is to select all columns needed to satisfy the # Primary Goal.

# Primary Goal
{select_instruction}
{alias_instruction}

# User question
{prompt}

# Context
{context}

# Query Construction Rules
1. For questions about "who", "what", or "list", use DISTINCT to avoid duplicate results.
2. When filtering, always explicitly exclude NULL values (e.g., `your_column IS NOT NULL`).
3. For questions about "today", you MUST use one of the formats provided in the # TODAY context. Choose the format that matches the data in the relevant date column. If the column is TEXT, you may need to use string matching (e.g., `your_column LIKE 'YYYY-MM-DD%'`).
4. For searches involving a person's name, use a `LIKE` clause for partial matching (e.g., `name_column LIKE 'John%'`).
5. If a Japanese name includes an honorific like "さん", remove the honorific before using the name in the query.
6. For keyword searches (e.g., 'Rust'), it is vital to search across multiple fields. Your `WHERE` clause must use `LIKE` and `OR` to check for the keyword in all plausible text columns based on the schema. For example, you should check fields like `subject_name`, `class_name`, and `memo`.
7. **Crucially, do not format data in the query** (e.g., using `TO_CHAR` or `FORMAT`). Return raw numbers and dates. Formatting is handled separately.
8. **Compatibility Constraint**: You MUST NOT use subqueries (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM (SELECT ...)` or `WHERE col IN (SELECT ...)`). Use `JOIN`s or simplified `WHERE` clauses instead.
9. Use the provided table schema to ensure the query is correct. Do not use placeholders for table or column names."#;

// --- Knowledge Augmentation ---
pub const KNOWLEDGE_AUGMENTATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT: &str = r#"You are an expert content analyst. Your task is to generate a high-quality, comprehensive question for EACH of the provided text blocks (Content Chunks).

# Instructions:
1.  Analyze each "Content Chunk" provided in the input. Each chunk is clearly separated and has a unique integer ID.
2.  For each chunk, create a single, clear question that the content fully and accurately answers.
3.  The question should be phrased as a real user would ask it and must contain rich keywords for better searchability.
4.  **Language Rule**: You **MUST** generate the question in the same language as the original 'Content Chunk'. For example, if the content is in Thai, the question must be in Thai.
5.  Return a single JSON object containing a list named `augmented_faqs`. Each item in the list must correspond to one of the input chunks.

# JSON Output Schema:
{
  "augmented_faqs": [
    {
      "id": <The integer ID of the original content chunk>,

// --- Knowledge Metadata Extraction ---
pub const KNOWLEDGE_METADATA_EXTRACTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT: &str = r#"You are an expert document analyst. Your task is to analyze the following text and extract three types of metadata: **Category**, **Keyphrases**, and **Entities**.

# Instructions:
1.  **Crucial Filtering Rule**: You **MUST NOT** extract generic user identifiers as entities. Specifically, any text matching the pattern "สมาชิกหมายเลข" followed by numbers is considered a generic identifier and must be ignored. These are not useful entities.
2.  **Category**: Determine the single, high-level category of the content. This should be a broad classification like "Love Story", "Tech Tutorial", "Product Review", or "Travel Guide".
3.  **Keyphrases**: Identify the 5-10 most important thematic concepts or topics in the text. These should capture the main ideas and themes, such as "unrequited love", "financial problems", or "betrayal".
4.  **Entities**: Identify specific, proper nouns, but **exclude** the generic identifiers mentioned in rule #1.
5.  **Language Rule**: You **MUST** generate all metadata in the same language as the original text. For example, if the content is in Thai, all metadata must be in Thai.
6.  Return a single JSON array of objects. Do not include any other text or explanations.

# JSON Object Schema:
Each object in the array must have the following keys:
- `type`: Must be one of 'CATEGORY', 'KEYPHRASE', or 'ENTITY'.
- `subtype`: For 'ENTITY', specify what it is (e.g., 'PERSON', 'PRODUCT'). For 'CATEGORY' and 'KEYPHRASE', use 'CONCEPT'.
- `value`: The extracted string value.

# Available Tools

1.  **`text_to_sql`**
    *   **Description:** Use this tool for precise, structured data retrieval. Best for prompts that mention specific columns (e.g., `rating`), tables, or ask for aggregations like counts or averages.
    *   **Query Format:** A natural language question that can be converted to SQL.

2.  **`knowledge_search`**
    *   **Description:** Use this for broad, semantic, or conceptual searches. Best for prompts that ask for the 'best' items, 'most relevant' stories, or are about a general topic. This uses a hybrid search that understands meaning.
    *   **Query Format:** A concise search query describing the core concept.
