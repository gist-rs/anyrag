# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values.

# IMPORTANT: This application now uses a `config.yml` file for detailed
# configuration of AI providers and prompts. Please copy either
# `config.local.yml` (for Ollama, LM Studio, etc.) or `config.gemini.yml`
# (for Google Gemini) to a new file named `config.yml` and customize it.
#
# The environment variables below are used to substitute `${VAR_NAME}` placeholders
# in your `config.yml`, keeping secrets out of the configuration file.

# --- Secrets ---
# Your API key for the selected AI Provider (e.g., Google Gemini).
# This is referenced as `${AI_API_KEY}` in config.yml.
AI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# A secret key for signing and validating JWTs. If not set, a default,
# less secure key is used. It is highly recommended to set this in production.
JWT_SECRET=a-very-secure-secret-key-that-you-should-change

# --- Provider URLs ---
# The full URL for the primary AI provider's API endpoint.
# Referenced as `${AI_API_URL}` in config.yml.
# Example for Gemini: https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash-lite:generateContent
# Example for Local AI: http://localhost:1234/v1/chat/completions
AI_API_URL=http://localhost:1234/v1/chat/completions

# The URL for the text embeddings model.
# Referenced as `${EMBEDDINGS_API_URL}` in config.yml.
