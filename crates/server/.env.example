# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values.
#
# IMPORTANT: This application now uses a `config.yml` file for detailed
# configuration of AI providers and prompts. Please copy either
# `config.local.yml` (for Ollama, LM Studio, etc.) or `config.gemini.yml`
# (for Google Gemini) to a new file named `config.yml` and customize it.
#
# The environment variables below are used to substitute `${VAR_NAME}` placeholders
# in your `config.yml`, keeping secrets out of the configuration file.

# --- Secrets ---
# Your API key for a cloud-based AI Provider (e.g., Google Gemini).
# This is referenced as `${AI_API_KEY}` in config.yml. Not needed for most local providers.
AI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# A secret key for signing and validating JWTs. If not set, a default,
# less secure key is used. It is highly recommended to set this in production.
JWT_SECRET=a-very-secure-secret-key-that-you-should-change

# --- Google OAuth 2.0 (for CLI Login) ---
# These are required to enable the `anyrag-cli login` feature.
# You can get these from the Google Cloud Console under "APIs & Services > Credentials".

GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-oauth-client-secret
SERVER_BASE_URL=http://localhost:9090

# --- Provider URLs ---
# The URL for your self-hosted or local AI provider (e.g., Ollama, LM Studio).
# This is referenced as `${LOCAL_AI_API_URL}` in config.yml.
# The Gemini provider URL is now hardcoded in the config and does not need to be set here.
LOCAL_AI_API_URL=http://localhost:1234/v1/chat/completions

# The URL for the text embeddings model.
# Referenced as `${EMBEDDINGS_API_URL}` in config.yml.
# Example for Local AI: http://localhost:1234/v1/embeddings

# --- Operational Variables ---
# The port for the server to listen on.
PORT=9090

# The path to the local SQLite database file.
DB_URL=db/anyrag.db

# Sets the logging level. Valid levels: trace, debug, info, warn, error

# --- Example-Specific & GCP Variables ---
# The ID of your Google Cloud project. This is used only for running
# the BigQuery-specific example, not for the main server startup.
BIGQUERY_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id

# Path to your GCP service account credentials. Required for the BigQuery example.
